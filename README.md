# haptic-medical-image-exploration
## Project Overview

This project presents a software-based prototype for simulating haptic feedback from medical images. The system processes MRI scans to extract structural boundaries and converts them into simulated tactile signals that represent variations in tissue structure. These signals are then mapped to an interactive visualization interface, allowing users to explore the image while observing changes in feedback intensity.

The prototype includes both an interactive exploration component and an automated processing pipeline. The interactive module demonstrates how simulated tactile cues can guide user navigation across image regions, while the batch processing module evaluates feedback distributions across multiple images and generates reproducible outputs. By integrating image processing, interaction design, and quantitative analysis, the project explores how computational methods can approximate tactile guidance in digital medical imaging environments.

This work aims to investigate how structure-driven feedback mechanisms could support perception-aware interfaces in medical visualization systems, particularly in contexts where tactile cues may improve user understanding of spatial and structural features.
